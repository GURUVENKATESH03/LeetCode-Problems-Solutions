Intuition
1.The intuition behind this solution is to iterate through the array of numbers, identifying consecutive numbers to form ranges.
2.We maintain two pointers, start and end, to track the start and end of each range.

Approach
1.Initialize an empty list result to store the ranges.
2.If the input array nums is null or empty, return an empty list.
3.Initialize variables start and end to the first element of nums.
4.Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
5.If the current element is consecutive to the previous one, update the end variable.
6.If not, add the current range (from start to end) to the result list, update start and end to the current element, and continue the iteration.
7.After the loop, add the last range to the result list.
8.Return the result list.

Complexity
Time complexity:
The algorithm iterates through the input array once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) because we use additional space to store the resulting ranges.
